Subject: Summary of NGINX Rate Limiting Implementation and Testing

Hi [Team/Manager’s Name],

As part of our traffic control and resilience enhancement efforts, I explored and tested various rate-limiting techniques provided in the NGINX blog on rate limiting.

Here’s a quick summary of the approaches tried and successfully implemented:

⸻

1. Request Rate Limiting (limit_req)
	•	Applied per IP using $binary_remote_addr.
	•	Verified burst handling with and without the nodelay parameter.
	•	Confirmed behavior by simulating burst traffic and observing request accept/reject patterns.

2. Connection Limiting (limit_conn)
	•	Configured to control the number of concurrent connections per IP.
	•	Ensured fairness by limiting excessive simultaneous connections from a single source.

3. Combined Rate and Connection Limits
	•	Deployed both limit_req and limit_conn together for layered protection.
	•	Useful to protect against both high request rates and connection flooding.

4. Burst Queue with and without nodelay
	•	With nodelay: Requests are immediately processed if within burst.
	•	Without nodelay: Requests are queued and spaced out to honor the rate.
	•	Tested queue overflow behavior and confirmed correct 503 response for over-limit conditions.

5. Custom Key-Based Rate Limiting
	•	Explored limiting by headers (like API keys or user identifiers).
	•	Effective for tenant-based or authenticated user-level throttling.

⸻

All methods have been validated using real-time traffic simulation and logs to ensure the correct application of rate-limiting policies. We can confidently proceed with applying these configurations in appropriate environments (staging/production) as needed.

Please let me know if any additional testing or use-case coverage is required.





I recently worked on automating heap dump generation and analysis. Previously, we used an ActionEngine to collect New Relic data, generate heap dumps, and take necessary actions. However, this process had an 8–10-minute delay, during which significant issues could occur.

To address this, we implemented a pre-stop hook script. The script monitors a specified heap dump path, uploads the generated heap dump to an S3 bucket, and triggers the MatAnalyzer tool for further analysis. The solution introduces two parameters: heap dump path and heap dump location. These parameters ensure the heap dump is created at a defined location, enabling the pre-stop hook to handle it before the pod is terminated.


Subject: Migration to BG-IAS Roles for EC2 and Other Services

Dear Team,

We have identified an IAM role that includes “EC2” in its name, which is not associated with any stack. As a result, it has been marked as an isolated role.

Since this role is isolated, we do not have control over updating it. To address this, we have created a new set of roles. Moving forward, we request the team to start using the BG-IAS role for EC2 creation, as the existing EC2 role may not be appropriate for future use and could be deleted at any time.

For other services, please ensure you use the relevant attached roles accordingly.

Additionally, please share this information with any relevant stakeholders who may need to be informed.

Thank you for your cooperation.


We tested this approach on a test pod, and it has performed successfully so far. After thorough validation, we plan to present it in a demo.
